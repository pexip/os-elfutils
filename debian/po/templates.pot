"While debugging programs (with GDB, for example) or using debuginfo-consumer "
"applications, it is possible to connect to Debian's debuginfod server and "
"download the necessary debug information for the program you are debugging "
"on-the-fly, without the need to configure the debian-debug apt repository "
"nor installing any dbgsym packages.  This service is maintained by Debian, "
"and the only information you will have to send to it is the Build-ID hash of "
"the program(s)/library(ies) being debugged."
