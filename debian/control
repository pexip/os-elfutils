Package: elfutils
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends},
  libelf1 (= ${binary:Version}), libdw1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: collection of utilities to handle ELF objects
 Elfutils is a collection of utilities, including eu-ld (a linker),
 eu-nm (for listing symbols from object files), eu-size (for listing the
 section sizes of an object or archive file), eu-strip (for discarding
 symbols), eu-readelf (to see the raw ELF file structures), and eu-elflint
 (to check for well-formed ELF files).

Package: libelf1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: library to read and write ELF files
 The libelf1 package provides a shared library which allows reading and
 writing ELF files on a high level.  Third party programs depend on
 this package to read internals of ELF files.  The programs of the
 elfutils package use it also to generate new ELF files.
 .
 This library is part of elfutils.

Package: libelf-dev

Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libelf1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, zlib1g-dev
Conflicts: libelfg0-dev
Description: libelf1 development libraries and header files
 libelf1 provides a shared library which allows reading and writing of ELF
 files on a high level.
 .
 This package contains development libraries and header files for libelf1.

Package: libdw-dev

Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libelf-dev, libdw1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends},
  zlib1g-dev, liblzma-dev
Description: libdw1 development libraries and header files
 libdw1 provides a library that provides access to DWARF debug information
 stored inside ELF files.
 .
 This package contains development libraries and header files for libdw1.
 .
 It also contains a static version of libdw.  Only link to the static version
 for special cases and when you don't need anything from the ebl backends.

Section: devel
Architecture: any
Depends: libdebuginfod1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: debuginfo-related http file-server daemon
 Server, client tool and library to index and fetch ELF/DWARF files
 addressed by build-id through HTTP.

Package: libdebuginfod-common

Section: devel
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ucf
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}, debconf
Description: configuration to enable the Debian debug info server
 This package asks if it should enable use of the Debian debug info
 server with debugging tools that use libdebuginfo such as GDB.
 .
 When this is allowed by the sysadmin, a snippet will be added to the
 shell configuration. You will need to restart your shell after
 installing this package before the snippet will work.
 .
 The Debian debug info server will be contacted every time debugging
 tools attempt to look up debug info for binaries or libraries but the
 server does not log requests for debug info.
 .
 The Debian debug info server uses https to securely transfer debugging
 files but does not offer OpenPGP signing of debug info.
